Hi I am Riko,

I have started developing things about almost 20 years now.
If I have the opportunity and time I always start to learn new languages, the learning must go on ;).
Actually I have senior skills in php7+/Html5/CSS3/Javascript/Socket.io/Java/C#/Android/C++ languages.

Long story short I try to keep up with the actual technologys.

Best Regards:
And don't turn on the lights, it's attracting bugs. ;)
